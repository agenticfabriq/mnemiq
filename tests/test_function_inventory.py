"""What the source says about its own functions, and the three states that answer can be in.

The engine cannot tell a builtin from a same-named UDF by parsing -- sqlglot types `log` as a
builtin before the source binds it. Two controls settle for less because of it: lineage declines
to certify on ANY call (issue #5, so `count(*)` trips it), and the decider allows any name
sqlglot models, so a UDF called `median` passes (M43's residual). Both want the same fact.
